/**
 * MathCanvas is a class that gives programmers an easy way to display Mathematica graphics
 * or typeset expressions. This class can be used in either Mathematica programs or Java programs.
 * MathCanvas is the AWT counterpart to the Swing-based MathGraphicsJPanel (MathCanvas would
 * have been better named MathGraphicsCanvas). Use a MathCanvas if you are writing an AWT program
 * and a MathGraphicsJPanel if you are writing a Swing program.
 * <p>
 * A typical use is in a Mathematica program where you want to display a window that contains a
 * Mathematica graphic or typeset expression. To do this, you would create a MathCanvas, create a
 * Frame to hold it (perhaps a MathFrame), then use the setMathCommand() method to specify a plotting
 * command that will be used by the MathCanvas to create the image to display. One of the sample
 * programs included with J/Link, and described in detail in the User Guide, demonstrates this.
 * <p>
 * MathCanvas operates in one of two modes: it either evaluates a command in Mathematica to produce
 * the image to display, or it displays a Java Image that you set directly with the setImage() method.
 * In the latter case, the Mathematica command is ignored and no computations are performed.
 * <p>
 * This class is a JavaBean.
 * 
 * @see MathGraphicsJPanel
